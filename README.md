# udacity-android-advanced-nanodegree
As part of Google Udacity Developer Scholarship awarded to me, I have to complete Udacity's Advanced Nanodegree for Android. All my projects will be displayed in this repository

### Project 1: Sandwich App (Very Basic Stuff of Json Parsing and Recycler View => REMOVED)

### Project 2: Popular Movies Stage 1 (WATCHIFY)
This app was developed to get content from API and display it using recycler view. The Key areas in this project in addition to coordinator layout, parallax effect, butterknife (All previous projects) are :
* First Run Screens (Fragments which run only on first run to educate the user => ViewPager and Fragment Adapter)
* Using Volley (Efficient use of Library) - The app always checks for cache before making a call and always uses cache in case there is data availavle
* Using Picasso to load movie images/posters/backdrops
* Use Of Parcelable to transfer data with Intent
* Card Views

### Project 3: Popular Movies Stage 2 (WATCHIFY) - An extension to stage 1
* Live Data to optimize and remove unnecessary querying of database to check for changes
* View Model for making the tasks in activity lifecycle aware in case of activity recreation(rotation etc.)
* Room Object Relational Mapping - making Database Operations easier and optimized
* Multiple consecutive API calls, Data Parsing and Handling (multiple recycler views)
* Lambda Functions to optimize code and take advantage of Java 8
* Thread Executors to deal with multiple threads
* Singleton Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Dependency Injection (Butterknife, also used in previous project)
* Flat View Hierarchy(removed recursive views from stage 1 and obtained a flatter and better view hierarchy using constraint layout)


### Project 4: Working on it
