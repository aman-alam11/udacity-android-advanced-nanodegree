# udacity-android-advanced-nanodegree
As part of Google Udacity Developer Scholarship awarded to me, I have to complete Udacity's Advanced Nanodegree for Android. All my projects will be displayed in this repository

### Project 1 and 2 are basically contained in project 3 and project 3 is an extension to project 2

### Project 3: Popular Movies Stage 2 (WATCHIFY) - An extension to stage 1
* Live Data to optimize and remove unnecessary querying of database to check for changes
* View Model for making the tasks in activity lifecycle aware in case of activity recreation(rotation etc.)
* Room Object Relational Mapping - making Database Operations easier and optimized
* Multiple consecutive API calls, Data Parsing and Handling (multiple recycler views)
* Lambda Functions to optimize code and take advantage of Java 8
* Thread Executors to deal with multiple threads
* Singleton Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Dependency Injection (Butterknife, also used in previous project)
* Flat View Hierarchy(removed recursive views from stage 1 and obtained a flatter and better view hierarchy using constraint layout)
* Card Views
* First Run Screens (Fragments which run only on first run to educate user => view pager and fragment adapter)
* Using Volley to check cache and use it (no need to make futile internet calls everytime)
* Using Picasso to load movie posters
