# udacity-android-advanced-nanodegree
As part of Google Udacity Developer Scholarship awarded to me, I have to complete Udacity's Advanced Nanodegree for Android. All my projects will be displayed in this repository

### Project 1: Sandwich App
This app was developed to parse API response(JSON) without any 3rd party libraries and display it using a recycler view. 
The recycler view click would open up new activities with all the data populated. The key areas in this project-
* Coordinate Layout
* Parallax Effect for app bar using Design Library
* Constraint layout inside Coordinator layout using nested scroll view
* ButterKnife (in progress)

### Project 2: -
